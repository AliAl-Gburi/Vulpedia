                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p><img class="right" src="../images/swiftrange.png" alt="swift fox map range">The swift fox lives in short-grass prairies and western grassland. They form their dens in sandy soil on open prairies, in plowed fields, or along fences. It is native to the Great Plains region of North America, and its range extends north to the southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, and south to Texas. It reaches from western Iowa to Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Montana.</p>

                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p><img class="left" src="../images/swiftfoxfamily.jpg" alt="swift fox family">In the wild, the swift fox usually lives 3â€“6 years, but may surprisingly live up to 14 years in captivity. It is primarily nocturnal, spending only evenings and nighttime above ground in the summer. Daytime activities are usually confined to the den, but it has been known to spend the warm midday period above ground during the winter. The swift fox is more heavily dependent on its den than most North American canids, using them as shelter from predators. These dens are usually burrows that are two to four meters in length. It has been known to run very fast, at speeds of over 50 km/h (30 mph). or up to 60 km/h (40 mph) The coyote is the swift fox's main predator, but often chooses not to consume the swift fox.</p>
                <br>
                <p><img class="right" src="../images/swifteating.jpg" alt="swift fox eating">Swift foxes are a socially monogamous species, although multiple breeding strategies have been observed. The adult swift fox's breeding season varies with region. In the southern United States, it mates between December and February with pups born in March and early April, while in Canada, the breeding season begins in March, and pups are born in mid-May.</p>
